# Spring Data - REST Integration with Angular UI - ng-grid

## Introduction ##

[Spring Data - REST](http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/rest "Spring Data -Rest") provides a simple way to expose the Spring Data Repositories using REST. The [Angular UI - DataGrid](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid) component is used to display and page through the server-side data.

## Running the example: ##

```
mvn jetty:run
```
and then browse to:

http://localhost:8080/app/index.html
